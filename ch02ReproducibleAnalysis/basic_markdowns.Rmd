## Cross referencing
[First section][Header big]

### Cross referencing {#section-cross-ref}
if the names are not unique, use curly brackets
[this section](#section-cross-ref)

## R coding
This will only display the code
```r
2+2
```

This will evaluate a single line

`r 2+2`

For chunk of code, use curly brackets - it will display the code and then the result
```{r}
2+2
```

You can name code chunks by putting a name right after r
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

##Showing results
```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(head(cars))
```

##Caching
```{r first_cache, cache=TRUE}
#when cached and unaltered, these random numbers should be the same
(x = rnorm(3))
```

Add dependencies to the first chunk and try if something changes if the first chunk is altered

```{r child_chunk, dependson='first_cache'}
mean(x)
```
