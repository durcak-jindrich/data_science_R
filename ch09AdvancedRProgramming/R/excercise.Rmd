### Between
Write a vectorized function that takes a vector x and two numbers, lower and upper, and replaces all elements in x smaller than lower or greater than upper with NA.
```{r}
between <- function(x,low,up){
  x[x < low | x > up] = NA
  x
}

```

### Apply if
Consider the function apply_if you implemented in this chapter. There we use a loop. Implement it using Filter and Map instead.
For the specific instance we used in the example:
```{r}
#apply_if(v, function(x) x %% 2 == 0, function(x) x^2)
library(dplyr)
a = 1:10
Filter(function(x) x %% 2 == 0, a) %>%
  Map(function(x) x^2, .) %>%
  unlist
```
### Row and column sum
Using apply, write the rowsum and colsum functions to compute the row sums and column sums, respectively, of a matrix.
```{r}
m <- matrix(1:16, nrow = 4)
apply(m,1, sum)
apply(m,2, sum)
```
