### Outer product
Write a function that computes the outer product of two vectors.  
u ⊗ v = uv<sup>t</sup>  
$u ⊗ v = uv^{t}$
```{r}
u = matrix(1:4, nrow = 4)
v = matrix(5:7, nrow = 3) 
op <- function(u,v){
  u %*% t(v)
}
op(u,v)
base::outer(u,v)
```

### Prealocate a vector
If a vector is preallocated, then R does not copy all the elements everytime something is added to the vector
```{r}
n <- 5
v <- vector(length = n)
v

#similarly for lists
vector("list", length = n)
```
